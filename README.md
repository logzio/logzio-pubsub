# logzio-pubsub

logzio-pubsub is a Docker container that uses Filebeat to collect logs from Google Cloud Platform through Pub/Sub and forward those logs to your Logz.io account.
<br/>/*
logzio-pubsub mounts docker.sock and the Docker logs directory to the container itself, allowing Filebeat to collect the logs and metadata.
<br/>
logzio-pubsub ships logs only. */<br/>

To use this container, you'll need:
1. A Google Cloud Platform project.
2. Topics and subscribers to your project, created on Cloud Pub/Sub.
3. A Sink to export your logs, created on Stackdriver.
4. A Pub/Sub input YAML file.

To complete these stages please follow the pre-setup. // link to pre-setup section <br/>
If you already have those go to logzio-pubsub setup. // link to setup section

## Pre-setup

### Quickstart with Cloud Pub/Sub
  Read about [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview).<br/>
  To create Cloud Pub/Sub topics and subscribers to your GCP project, [follow these steps](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-console).<br/>
    
### Export your logs
 To create a sink to export your logs, [follow these steps](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2).<br/> Use Cloud Pub/Sub as the destination.
### Build your Pub/Sub input YAML file
Build a YAML file called "pubsub-input.yml".<br/>
Fill it in the format as follows:<br/>
For every topic fill in project, topic and subscriptions IDs, as given from Pub/Sub.<br/>
Get your Logz.io [token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/general).<br/>
View example in [pubsub-input-example.yml](https://github.com/logzio/logzio-pubsub/blob/develop/pubsub-input-example.yml).

```yml
logzio-pubsub:
    listener: <"LISTENER_URL">
    pubsubs:
    - project_id: <PROJECT-1_ID>
      credentials_file: <PATH/TO/YOUR/FILE/credential-file.json>
      token: <LOGZIO_ACCOUNT_TOKEN>
      topic_id: <TOPIC-1_ID>
      subscriptions: <SUB1_ID, SUB2_ID, SUB3_ID, ...>
      type: <name your log type as a key>

    - project_id: <PROJECT-1_ID>
      credentials_file: <PATH/TO/YOUR/FILE/credential-file.json>
      token: <LOGZIO_ACCOUNT_TOKEN>
      topic_id: <TOPIC-2_ID>
      subscriptions: <SUB1_ID, SUB2_ID, SUB3_ID, ...>
      type: <name your log type as a key>

    - project_id: <PROJECT-2_ID>
      credentials_file: <PATH/TO/YOUR/FILE/credential-file.json>
      token: <LOGZIO_ACCOUNT_TOKEN>
      topic_id: <TOPIC-1_ID>
      subscriptions: <SUB1_ID, SUB2_ID, SUB3_ID, ...>
      type: <name your log type as a key>

    #and so on...
    
```

## logzio-pubsub setup

### 1. Pull the Docker image

Download the logzio/logzio-pubsub image:

```shell
docker pull logzio/logzio-pubsub
```

### 2. Run the container

```shell
docker run --name logzio-pubsub \
-v PATH/TO/YOUR/FILE//pubsub-input.yml:/var/lib/filebeat/pubsub-input.yml \
-v PATH/TO/YOUR/FILE//credential-file.json:/var/lib/filebeat/credential-file.json \
logzio/logzio-pubsub
```

### 3. Check Logz.io for your logs

Spin up your Docker containers if you havenâ€™t done so already. Give your logs a few minutes to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana).
