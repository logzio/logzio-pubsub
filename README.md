# Pub/Sub to Logz.io

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Stackdriver collects logs and metrics from your cloud services.
You can use Google Cloud Pub/Sub to forward your logs from Stackdriver to Logz.io.

#### Configuration

**Before you begin, you'll need**: 
* [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts)
* [a GCP project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)
* a GCP Pub/Sub [topic and subscribers](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-console) to your GCP project

<div class="tasklist">

##### 1. Export your logs to Stackdriver

Set up a sink to export your logs to Stackdriver.

For more information, see
[Exporting with the Logs Viewer](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2)
from Google Cloud.

##### 2. Build your credentials file

Create a working directory for this step and `cd` into it, run as root.

```shell
mkdir ~/logzio-pubsub && cd ~/logzio-pubsub
```

You'll need to build a credentials file so Pub/Sub can authenticate
and get the right permissions.

You can build it through:
* [The command line](#credentials-cmd) 
* [The Cloud console](#credentials-console)

<div id ="credentials-cmd">

###### Option 1: In the command line

Build your credentials file using your Google Cloud project ID.  
Before you begin make sure your 'gcloud' cli is installed. If not, execute the following:
  1. Download the 'google-cloud-sdk' to '~/logzio-pubsub'
  2. Run  ```~/logzio-pubsub/google-cloud-sdk/install.sh```
 
Then replace '<project_id>' with your project id and run:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logzio/logzio-pubsub/master/create_credentials.py \
&& python create_credentials.py PROJECT_ID=<project_id>
```

Run this command for each project you're working with.  
**Important note: If you are renaming the file please follow [these steps](#cred-info) as well.


</div>
<div id ="credentials-console">

###### Option 2: In the Cloud Console

* Go to your project's page in [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
In the left menu, select **IAM & admin > Service accounts**.

* At the top of the _Service accounts_ page, click **+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**.

* Give a descriptive **Service account name**, such as "logzio-credentials-file".
Click **CREATE** to continue to the _IAM/permissions_ page.

* Add the role: 'Pub/Sub Editor'.

* Click **CONTINUE** to _Grant users access to this service account_.
Click **ADD KEY + CREATE NEW KEY** to open the _Create key_ panel.
Select **JSON** and click **CREATE** to save the private key to your machine.

* Click **DONE** to return to the _Service accounts_ page.

* Rename it in the following format: '<<project-id>>-credentials.json' - replace to your project id.  
Move it to the `~/logzio-pubsub` folder you've created
at the beginning of this step.  
**Important note: If you are naming it differently please follow [these steps](#cred-info) as well.

</div>

##### 3. Build your Pub/Sub input YAML file

Make `pubsub-input.yml`, which will hold your Pub/Sub input configuration.

```shell
touch ~/logzio-pubsub/pubsub-input.yml && open ~/logzio-pubsub/pubsub-input.yml
```
Paste this code block to your opened file and complete the configuration instructions. ðŸ‘‡

```yaml
listener: <<LISTENER-HOST>>
pubsubs:
 - project_id: PROJECT-1_ID
   topic_id: TOPIC-1_ID
   token: <<SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
   subscriptions: [SUB1_ID, SUB2_ID, SUB3_ID]
   type: stackdriver

 - project_id: PROJECT-1_ID
   topic_id: TOPIC-2_ID
   token: <<SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
   subscriptions: [SUB1_ID, SUB2_ID, SUB3_ID]
   type: stackdriver

 - project_id: PROJECT-3_ID
   topic_id: TOPIC-1_ID
   token: <<SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
   subscriptions: [SUB1_ID, SUB2_ID, SUB3_ID]
   type: stackdriver
```
** Note that YAML files are sensitive to spaces and tabs. We recommend using a YAML validator to make sure that the file structure is correct.

###### Configuration instructions

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| listener | The Logz.io listener host. (Default value: `listener.logz.io`) <br> Replace `<<LISTENER-HOST>>` with your region's listener host. For more information on finding your account's region, see [Account region](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html). |
| pubsubs | This is an array of one or more GCP subscriptions. For each topic, provide topic and subscriptions IDs, as given from Pub/Sub. |
| token | Your Logz.io shipping token. For each project under `pubsubs`. <br> Replace `<<SHIPPING-TOKEN>>` with the [token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/general) of the account you want to ship to. You can send your logs to different accounts that are in the same region, you can do that by inserting different tokens. |
| credentials_file (Not required, Default value: '<project_id>-credentials.json') | This field is only required if your credentials file is named differently than the default value. For an example of adding this field go to [input example file](https://github.com/logzio/logzio-pubsub/blob/master/pubsub-input-example.yml). |

##### 4. Pull the Docker image

Download the logzio/logzio-pubsub image:

```shell
docker pull logzio/logzio-pubsub
```

##### 5. Run the container

Replace <<PROJECT_ID>>  with your project id and run this command.  
Important notes:  
** If you've named your credentials file manually follow [these steps](#cred-info) as well.   
** When working with multiple topics, for every credentials file you've created add this line:  
```-v ~/logzio-pubsub/<<PROJECT_ID>>-credentials.json:/logzio-pubsub/<<PROJECT_ID>>-credentials-file.json \```
and insert your project id instead of the parameters.

```shell
docker run --name logzio-pubsub \
-v ~/logzio-pubsub/pubsub-input.yml:/logzio-pubsub/pubsub-input.yml \
-v ~/logzio-pubsub/<<PROJECT_ID>>-credentials.json:/logzio-pubsub/<<PROJECT_ID>>-credentials.json \
logzio/logzio-pubsub
```

#### 6. Check Logz.io for your logs

Spin up your Docker containers if you havenâ€™t done so already.  
Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours,
and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana).

<div id="cred-info">

####  Information about the credentials file
When creating the credentials file through the [command line](#credentials-cmd) your credentials file is named by default in the following format:  
'<<project_id>>-credentials.json'.  
When creating the credentials file through the [gcp console](#credentials-console) you are requested to name the file in that format.  
In both cases, if you wish to name it differently please follow these instructions:
1. On step 3 - building your 'pubsub-input.yml' file, please add the field 'credentials_file' with your credentials file's name as the value.
For an example of adding this field go to [input example file](https://github.com/logzio/logzio-pubsub/blob/master/pubsub-input-example.yml).
2. On step 5 - running the docker, for every credentials file you've created add this line:
'-v ~/logzio-pubsub/<credentials-file-name>.json:/logzio-pubsub/<credentials-file-name>.json \'
and replace '<credentials-file-name>' with your credentials file's name.
